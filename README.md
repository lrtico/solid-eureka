###Backend server
From the project's directions:
"You will start with [local backend development server][https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter]. The server is built in Node, but it is very simple. You won't need to edit the server code; instead, your code will talk to the server using documented API endpoints. You can use the server's endpoints to manage storing, reading, updating, and deleting data for your application.

Using this server, you will build a React/Redux front end for the application. The specification provided below is the minimum required for this project. You may extend your project however you like, however, as long as the minimum specification is met."
